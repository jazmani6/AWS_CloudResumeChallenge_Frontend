            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I am a Computer Engineering graduate from York University, with strong experience in an IT environment.
    
                As an L2 Support Engineer at IBM, I have been able to gain hands on experience in Linux system administration (RedHat Certified Systems Administrator), as well as in database administration (PostgreSQL), containerization and orchestration (Docker/OpenShift), and knowledge of TCP/IP networking, and I have been able to apply this knowledge in enterprise-level customer production environments.
                
                I am interested in learning more about Cloud Engineering and its concepts, as I also have experience working with IBM Cloud and AWS, as well as experience with IaC (Terraform), and a working knowledge of Python. </p>
